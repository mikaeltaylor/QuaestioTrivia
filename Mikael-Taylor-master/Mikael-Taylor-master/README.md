Quaestio is a trivia app that will allow players to choose various degrees of difficulty, and compete with their friends.  It's going to have a unique tie-breaker that is a game of rock-paper-scissors. It will also have trivia divided by categories and difficulty, offering the ability to earn more points for harder trivia, and less for easier. It's going to be pretty cool. Hopefully.
